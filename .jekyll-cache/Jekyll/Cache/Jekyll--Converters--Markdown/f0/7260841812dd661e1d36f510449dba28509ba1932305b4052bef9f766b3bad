I"ø<p>ESG - Environmental, Social, and Governance, initially thought of as a lens to measure the societal impact of investments in businesses and firms, has evolved and has become a key focus area for investors. Since its inception in 1970 - by selective disinvestment in companies operated in South Africa to show the abhorrence against the regime, it has changed over time into a more concrete concept. Earlier, it was believed that the return on investment in sustainable businesses will comparatively be less than other businesses. But this turned out to be false. Now, after many years of empirical research by various academic researchers and investors, it has been proven that sustainable businesses are efficient and provide better financial returns.</p>
