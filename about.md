Diptendra is currently pursuing his M.S. in Statistics from [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://stat.illinois.edu/). He is also working as a Consultant at the Illinois Business Consulting, where he leverages his problem-solving and quantitative skills to solve business problems from various domains.

He has four years of professional work experience in the data science/data consulting, primarily in the Retail/CPG sector, on various cutting-edge and strategic analytical problems.

In the past he has worked with Anheuser-Busch InBev and Target as a Data Science professional, where he had not only worked on challenging problems in Retail/CPG but also lead a team of 2 individuals and managed multiple projects simultaneously. One of his biggest learnings has been to go out of comfort zone and learn more about the business problem before diving to solve it. He loves working in cross-functional team with individual's from different backgrounds because he believes diversity in perspectives drives innovation.

He received his MS in Economics (2013-2015) from [Madras School of Economics](https://www.mse.ac.in/) and BSc.(Hons.) in Physics (2009-2012) from [Hindu College, University of Delhi](http://www.hinducollege.ac.in/).
